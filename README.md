# Excel parser with sds and altium BOM
This program helps the designer to fill in the missing fields of BOM files when transferring them for PCB assembly.
## Discription
When uploading boom files from altium and ordering components from compel, it becomes necessary to compare the elements that needed to be bought with those that were bought.
The program allows you to compare boom files from altium and excel files from compel specifications. After matching, columns are created in the boom file with the items that were bought and their quantity. Compel excel creates a column with the number of used elements on the board, to control the number of purchased elements.
